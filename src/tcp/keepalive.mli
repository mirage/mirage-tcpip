(** TCP keepalives.

    A TCP implementation may send "keep-alives" (empty TCP ACKs with the
    sequence number set to one less than the current sequence number for
    the connection) in order to provoke the peer to respond with an ACK
    of the current sequence number. If the peer doesn't recognise the
    connection (e.g. because the connection state has been dropped) then
    it will return a RST; if the peer (or the network in-between) fails
    to respond to a configured number of repeated probes then the
    connection is assumed to be lost.
*)

type action =
  [ `SendProbe  (** we should send a keep-alive now *)
  | `Wait of Duration.t  (** sleep for a given number of nanoseconds *)
  | `Close  (** connection should be closed *) ]
(** An I/O action to perform *)

type state
(** State of a current connection *)

val alive : state
(** An alive connection *)

val next :
  configuration:Tcpip.Tcp.Keepalive.t -> ns:int64 -> state -> action * state
(** [next ~configuration ~ns state] returns the action we should take given
    that we last received a packet [ns] nanoseconds ago and the new state
    of the connection *)

  type t
  (** A keep-alive timer *)

  val create :
    Tcpip.Tcp.Keepalive.t -> ([ `SendProbe | `Close ] -> unit Lwt.t) -> t
  (** [create configuration f clock] returns a keep-alive timer which will call
      [f] in future depending on both the [configuration] and any calls to
      [refresh] *)

  val refresh : t -> unit
  (** [refresh t] marks the connection [t] as alive. This should be called
      when packets are received. *)
