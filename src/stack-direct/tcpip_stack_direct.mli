  (** [connect] assembles the arguments into a network stack, then calls
      `listen` on the assembled stack before returning it to the caller.  The
      initial `listen` functions to ensure that the lower-level layers (e.g.
      ARP) are functioning, so that if the user wishes to establish outbound
      connections, they will be able to do so. *)
