* Use Logs library for logging.
  Warning: Logs suppresses warnings and errors by default. Upgrading to the new
  tcpip version without configuring logs means that bugs in your code that
  previously resulted in an exception being displayed may now be silently
  ignored. Remember to configure Logs in your unit-tests too.

### 2.8.0 (2016-04-04)

* Provide an implementation for the ICMPV4 module type defined in mirage-types 2.8.0.  Remove default ICMP handling from the IPv4 module, but preserve it in tcpip-stack-direct. (#195 by @yomimono)
* Explicitly require the use of an OCaml compiler >= 4.02.3 . (#195 by @yomimono)
* Explicitly depend on `result`. (#195 by @yomimono)

### 2.7.0 (2016-03-20)
* Raise Invalid_argument if given an invalid port number in listen_{tcp,udp}v4
  (#173 by @matildah and #175 by @hannesm)
* Improve TCP options marshalling/unmarshalling (#174 by @yomimono)
* Add state tests and fixes for closure conditions (#177 #176 by @yomimono)
* Remove bogus warning (#178 by @talex5)
* Clean up IPv6 stack (#179 by @nojb)
* RST checking from RFC5961 (#182 by @ppolv)
* Transform EPIPE exceptions into `Eof (#183 by @djs55)
* Improve error strings in IPv4 (#184 by @yomimono)
* Replace use of cstruct.syntax with cstruct.ppx (#188 by @djs55)
* Make the Unix subpackages optional, so the core builds on Win32
  (#191 by @djs55)

### 2.6.1 (2015-09-15)

* Add optional arguments for settings in ip v6 and v4 connects (#170, by @Drup)
* Expose `Ipv4.Routing.No_route_to_destination_address` (#166, by @yomimono)

### 2.6.0 (2015-07-29)

* ARP now handles ARP frames, not Ethernet frames with ARP payload
  (#164, by @hannesm)
* Check length of received ethernet frame to avoid cstruct exceptions
  (#117, by @hannesm)
* Pull arpv4 module out of ipv4. Also add unit-tests for the newly created
  ARP library  (#155, by @yomimono)

### 2.5.1 (2015-07-07)

* Fix regression introduced in 2.5.0 where packet loss could lead to the
  connection to become very slow (#157, MagnusS, @talex5, @yomimono and
  @balrajsingh)
* Improve the tests: more logging, more tracing and compile to native code when
  available, etc (@MagnusS and @talex5)
* Do not raise `Invalid_argument("Lwt.wakeup_result")` everytime a connection
  is closed. Also now pass the raised exceptions to `Lwt.async_exception_hook`
  instead of ignoring them transparently, so the user can decide to shutdown
  its application if something wrong happens (#153, #156, @yomomino and @talex5)
* The `channel` library now lives in a separate repository and is released
  separately (#159, @samoht)

### 2.5.0 (2015-06-10)

* The test runs now produce `.pcap` files (#141, by @MagnusS)
* Strip trailing bytes from network packets (#145, by @talex5)
* Add tests for uniform packet loss (#147, by @MagnusS)
* fixed bug where in case of out of order packets the ack and window were set
  incorrectly (#140, #146)
* Properly handle RST packets (#107, #148)
* Add a `Log` module to control at runtime the debug statements which are
  displayed (#142)
* Writing in a PCB which does not have the right state now returns an error
  instead of blocking (#150)

  sequence (#131)

### 2.4.2 (2015-04-29)

* Fix a memory leak in `Channel` (#119, by @yomimono)
* Add basic unit-test for channels (#119, by @yomimono)
* Add alcotest testing templates
* Modernize Travis CI scripts

### 2.4.1 (2015-04-21)

* Merge between 2.4.0 and 2.3.1

### 2.4.0: (2015-03-24)

* ARP improvements (#118)

### 2.3.1 (2015-03-31)

* Do not raise an assertion if an IP frame has extra trailing bytes (#221).

### 2.3.0 (2015-03-09)

* Fix `STACKV4` for the `DEVICE` signature which has `connect` removed
  (in Mirage types 2.3+).

### 2.2.3 (2015-03-09)

* Add ICMPv6 error reporting functions (#101)
* Add universal IP address converters (#108)
* Add `error_message` functions for human-readable errors (#98)
* Improve debug logging for ICMP Destination Unreachable packets.
* Filter incoming frames by MAC address to stop sending unnecessary RSTs. (#114)
* Unhook unused modules `Sliding_window` and `Profiler` from the build. (#112)
* Add an explicit `connect` method to the signatures. (#100)

### 2.2.2 (2015-01-11)

* Readded tracing and ARP fixes which got accidentally reverted in the IPv6
  merge. (#96)

### 2.2.1 (2014-12-20)

* Use `Bytes` instead of `String` to begin the `-safe-string` migration in OCaml
  4.02.0 (#93).
* Remove dependency on `uint` to avoid the need for a C stub (#92).

### 2.2.0 (2014-12-18)

Add IPv6 support. This changeset minimises interface changes to the existing
`STACKV4` interfaces to faciliate a progressive merge.  The only visible
interface changes are:

* `IPV4.set_ipv4_*` functions have been renamed `IPV4.set_ip_*` because they
  are shared between IPV4 and IPV6.
* `IPV4.get_ipv4` and `get_ipv4_netmask` now return a `list` of `Ipaddr.V4.t`
  (again because this is the common semantics with IPV6.)
* Several types that had `v4` in their names (like `IPV4.ipv4addr`) have lost
  that particle.

### 2.1.1 (2014-12-12)

* Improve console printing for the DHCP client to output line
  breaks properly on Xen consoles.

### 2.1.0 (2014-12-07)

* Build Xen stubs separately, with `CFLAGS` from `mirage-xen` 2.1.0+.
  This allows us to use the red zone under x86_64 Unix again.
* Adding tracing labels and counters, which introduces a new dependency on the
  `mirage-profile` package.

### 2.0.3 (2014-12-05)

* Fixed race waiting for ARP response (#86).
* Move the the code that configures IPv4 address, netmask and gateways
  after receiving a successful lease out of the `Dhcp_clientv4` module
  and into `Stackv4` (#87)

### 2.0.2 (2014-12-01)

* Add IPv4 multicast to MAC address mapping in IPv4 output processing
  (#81 from Luke Dunstan).
* Improve formatting of DHCP console logging, including printing out options
  (#83).
* Build with -mno-red-zone on x86_64 to avoid stack corruption on Xen (#80).

### 2.0.1 (2014-11-04)

* Fixed race condition in the signalling between the rx/tx threads under load.
* Experimentally switch to immediate ACKs in TCPv4 by default instead of delayed ones.

### 2.0.0 (2014-11-02)

* Moved 1s complement checksum C code here from mirage-platform.
* Depend on `Console_unix` and `Console_xen` instead of `Console`.
* [socket] Do not return an `Eof` when writing 0-length buffer (#76).
* [socket] Accept callbacks now run in async threads instead of being serialised
  (#75).

### 1.1.6 (2014-07-20)

* Quieten down the stack logging rate by not announcing IPv6 packet discards.
* Raise exception `Bad_option` for unparseable or invalid TCPv4 options (#57).
* Fix linking error with module `Tcp_checksum` by lifting it into top library
  (#60).
* Add `opam` file to permit easier local pinning, and fix Travis to use this.

### 1.1.5 (2014-06-18)

* Ensure that DHCP completes before the application is started, so that
  unikernels that establish outgoing connections can do so without a race.
  (fix from Mindy Preston in #53, followup in #55)
* Add `echo`, `chargen` and `discard` services into the `examples/`
  directory. (from Mindy Preston in #52).

### 1.1.4 (2014-06-03)

* [tcp] Fully process the last `ACK` in a 3-way handshake for server connections.
  This ensures that a `FIN` is correctly transmitted upon application-initiated
  connection close. (fix from Mindy Preston in #51).

### 1.1.3 (2014-03-01)

* Expose IPV4 through the STACKV4 interface.

### 1.1.2 (2014-03-27)

* Fix DHCP variable length option parsing for MTU responses, which
  in turns improves robustness on Amazon EC2 (fix from @yomimono
  via mirage/mirage-tcpip#48)

### 1.1.1 (2014-02-21)

* Catch and ignore top-level socket exceptions (#219).
* Set `SO_REUSEADDR` on listening sockets for Unix (#218).
* Adapt the Stack interfaces to the v1.1.1 mirage-types interface
  (see mirage/mirage#226 for details).

### 1.1.0 (2014-02-03)

* Rewrite of the library as a set of functors that parameterize the
  stack across the `V1_LWT` module types from Mirage 1.1.x.  This removes
  the need to compile separate Xen and Unix versions of the stack.

### 0.9.5 (2013-12-08)

* Build for either Xen or Unix, depending on the value of the `OS` envvar.
* Shift to the `mirage-types` 0.5.0+ interfaces, which breaks the
  socket backend (temporarily).
* Port the direct stack to the new interfaces.
* Add Travis CI scripts.

### 0.9.4 (2013-08-09)

* Use the `Ipaddr` external library and remove the Homebrew
  equivalents in `Nettypes`.

### 0.9.3 (2013-07-18)

* Changes in module Manager: Removed some functions from the `.mli
  (plug/unplug) and added some modifications in the way the Manager
  interacts with the underlying module Netif. The Netif.create function
  does not take a callback anymore.

### 0.9.2 (2013-07-09)

* Improve TCP state machine for connection teardown.
* Limit fragment number to 8, and coalesce buffers if it goes higher.
* Adapt to mirage-platform-0.9.2 API changes.

### 0.9.1 (2013-06-12)

* Depend on mirage-platform-0.9.1 direct tuntap interfaces.
* Version bump to catch up with mirage-platform.

### 0.5.2 (08-Feb-2013-02-03)

* Encourage scatter-gather I/O all the time, rather than playing tricks
  with packet header buffers. This simplifies the output path considerably
  and cuts minor heap allocations down.
* Install the packed `cmx` along with the `cmxa` to ensure that the
  compiler can do cross-module optimization (this is not a fatal error,
  but will impact performance if the `cmx` file is not present).

### 0.5.1 (20-Dec-2012-12-20)

* Update socket stack to use Cstruct 0.6.0 API

### 0.5.0 (2012-12-20)

* Update Cstruct API to 0.6.0
* [tcp] write now blocks if the write buffer and write window are full

### 0.4.1 (2012-12-14)

* Add iperf self-test that creates two VIFs and transmits across
  them. This is a useful local test which stresses the bridge
  code using just one VM.
* Add support for attaching existing devices when initialising the
  network manager, via an optional `attached` parameter.
* Constrain TCP connect to be a `unit Lwt.t` instead of a polymorphic
  return value.
* Expose IPv4 netmask function.
* Reduce ARP verbosity to the console.
* Fix TCP fast recovery to wait until all in-flight packets are
  acked, rather then exiting early.

### 0.4.0 (11-Dec-2012-12-11)

* Require OCaml-4.00.0 or higher, and add relevant build fixes
  to deal with module packing.

### 0.3.1 (2012-12-10)

* Fix the DHCP client marshalling for IPv4 addresses.
* Expose the interface MAC address in the Manager signature.
* Tweak TCP ISN calculation to be more friendly on a 32-bit host.
* Add Manager.create ?devs to control the number of Netif devices
  constructed by default.
* Add Ethif.set/disable_promiscuous to permit directly tapping
  a network interface.

### 0.3.0 (2012-09-04)

* Initial public release.
