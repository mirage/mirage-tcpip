0.5.2 (08-Feb-2013):
* Encourage scatter-gather I/O all the time, rather than playing tricks 
  with packet header buffers. This simplifies the output path considerably
  and cuts minor heap allocations down.
* Install the packed `cmx` along with the `cmxa` to ensure that the
  compiler can do cross-module optimization (this is not a fatal error,
  but will impact performance if the `cmx` file is not present).

0.5.1 (20-Dec-2012):
* Update socket stack to use Cstruct 0.6.0 API

0.5.0 (20-Dec-2012):
* Update Cstruct API to 0.6.0
* [tcp] write now blocks if the write buffer and write window are full

0.4.1 (14-Dec-2012):
* Add iperf self-test that creates two VIFs and transmits across
  them. This is a useful local test which stresses the bridge
  code using just one VM.
* Add support for attaching existing devices when initialising the
  network manager, via an optional `attached` parameter.
* Constrain TCP connect to be a `unit Lwt.t` instead of a polymorphic
  return value.
* Expose IPv4 netmask function.
* Reduce ARP verbosity to the console.
* Fix TCP fast recovery to wait until all in-flight packets are
  acked, rather then exiting early.

0.4.0 (11-Dec-2012):
* Require OCaml-4.00.0 or higher, and add relevant build fixes
  to deal with module packing.

0.3.1 (10-Dec-2012):
* Fix the DHCP client marshalling for IPv4 addresses.
* Expose the interface MAC address in the Manager signature.
* Tweak TCP ISN calculation to be more friendly on a 32-bit host.
* Add Manager.create ?devs to control the number of Netif devices
  constructed by default.
* Add Ethif.set/disable_promiscuous to permit directly tapping
  a network interface.

0.3.0 (04-Sep-2012):
* Initial public release.
