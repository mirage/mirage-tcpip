===== 0.4.1 (14-Dec-2012) =====

* Add an iperf self-test that creates two VIFs and transmits across
  them. This is a useful 'localhost' test which stresses the bridge
  code using just one VM.

* Add support for attaching existing devices when initialising the
  network manager, via an optional `attached` parameter.

* Constrain TCP connect to be a `unit Lwt.t` instead of a polymorphic
  return value.

* Expose IPv4 netmask function.

* Reduce ARP verbosity to the console.

* Fix TCP fast recovery to wait until all in-flight packets are
  acked, rather then exiting early.

===== 0.4.0 (11-Dec-2012) =====

* Require OCaml-4.00.0 or higher, and add relevant build fixes
  to deal with module packing.

===== 0.3.1 (10-Dec-2012) =====

* Fix the DHCP client marshalling for IPv4 addresses.

* Expose the interface MAC address in the Manager signature.

* Tweak TCP ISN calculation to be more friendly on a 32-bit host.

* Add Manager.create ?devs to control the number of Netif devices
  constructed by default.

* Add Ethif.set/disable_promiscuous to permit directly tapping
  a network interface.

===== 0.3.0 (04-Sep-2012) =====

* Initial public release.
